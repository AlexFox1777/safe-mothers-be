#### Backend delpoyed at [Heroku](https://production-fe-labs17-safe.herokuapp.com/) <br>

## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

localhost:5000

- Clone this repo
- **npm install** to install all required dependencies
- **npm run server** to start the local server
- **npm test** to start server using testing environment

### Our backend was built using:
Node JS
For the following reasons:
-    Familiarity across team.
-    Scalibility.
-    Works with SMS messaging technology.
-    A number of JS libraries to aid in our vision.

## DB Helpers

### Mothers

`getMothers()` -> Returns all mothers

`getMotherById(id)` -> Returns a single mother by ID

`addMother(data)` -> Creates a single mother.

`updateMother(id, data)` -> Updates mother by provided id. 

`deleteMother(id)` -> Delete an organization by ID

<br>

### Drivers

`getDrivers()` -> Returns all Drivers

`getDriverById(id)` -> Returns a single driver by ID

`addDriver(data)` -> Creates a single driver.

`updateDriver(id, data)` -> Updates driver by provided id. 

`deleteDriver(id)` -> Delete an organization by ID

<br>

### SMS

`checkMotherRegistration` -> Returns mother by phone #

`findDriverPhone` -> Returns a driver by phone #

`statusOnline` -> Updates driver by phone # to online: true

`statusOffline` -> Updates driver by phone # to offline: false

`getVillages` -> Returns and array of villages

`getVillageById` -> Returns a village by id

`getRidesRequest` -> Returns an array of rides

`addMothersRideRequest` -> Creates a ride request

`addDriverRideRequest` -> Updates ride to assigned: true

`checkRideRequest` -> Return ride by ride Id

`updatePendingRequest` -> Updates the drivers pending status by driver Id

`getRideByDriverId` -> Returns driver by Id and if assigned: false

`updatedDriverAvailability` -> Updates driver availability by Id

`reassignFailedRides` -> Querys the database to find rides that have not been completed and have not been assigned. Then checks if those rides have expired 5 minutes past time of ride initiation.The drivers that failed to respone, their availability is set to false.Then it reassigns those rides with new drivers and messages those drivers to accept the ride request.Next those failed rides, pending is set to true so the system knows the ride is waiting for the new driver to respone.If a new driver responses then pending is set back to false.
